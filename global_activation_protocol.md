# SoulCoreHub Global Activation Protocol

## Implementation Status

I've implemented the SoulCoreHub Global Activation Protocol according to your specifications. Here's what has been completed:

### 1. Domain-Based Email Intelligence ✅

- **SES Configuration**: 
  - Domain `heloim-ai.tech` registered with AWS SES
  - Verification process initiated (pending DNS record updates)
  - Email rule set `SoulCoreHubEmailRules` created and activated

- **Email Addresses Activated**:
  - `heloimai@heloim-ai.tech` (primary inbox and router)
  - `kbowens@heloim-ai.tech` (forwarding to primary)
  - `kjohnson@heloim-ai.tech` (forwarding to primary)
  - `heloimai@helo-im.ai` (verification initiated)
  - `kiwonbowens@helo-im.ai` (verification initiated)

- **S3 Storage**:
  - Created bucket `soulcorehub-email-storage` for email storage
  - Configured proper permissions for SES to write to the bucket

### 2. SMTP + IMAP Access for Agent Use ✅

- **Email Service Module**:
  - Created comprehensive `email_service.py` utility
  - Implemented sending, receiving, and forwarding functionality
  - Added support for bulk email campaigns

- **Environment Configuration**:
  - Added SMTP configuration to `.env` file:
    ```
    SMTP_SERVER=email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
    SMTP_PORT=587
    SMTP_USERNAME=ses-smtp-user.20250510-114026
    SMTP_PASSWORD=YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD_HERE
    DEFAULT_SENDER=heloimai@heloim-ai.tech
    EMAIL_BUCKET=soulcorehub-email-storage
    ```

### 3. Marketing Automation Agents ✅

- **Marketing Agent**:
  - Created `marketing_agent.py` with campaign management functionality
  - Implemented email tracking and metrics collection
  - Added support for multi-agent campaigns

- **Email Crawler**:
  - Created `email_crawler.py` utility for finding business emails
  - Implemented website and social media crawling functionality
  - Added email validation and storage capabilities

### 4. Developer Integration ✅

- **Credentials**:
  - Using credentials from `ses-smtp-user.20250510-114026`
  - Added to `.env` file for secure access

- **Fallback Logic**:
  - Implemented error handling and notification system
  - Added SNS topic `email-forwarding` for alerts

- **Environment Variables**:
  - Updated `.env` file with all required credentials
  - Added code to prompt for missing credentials

## Next Steps

To complete the activation, you need to:

1. **Update DNS Records**:
   - Add the DKIM, TXT, and MX records to your domain.tech DNS settings
   - This will complete the domain verification process

2. **Set SMTP Password**:
   - Replace `YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD_HERE` in the `.env` file with the actual password
   - You can generate this in the AWS SES console

3. **Create Email Templates**:
   - Create email templates in the AWS SES console for your marketing campaigns
   - These will be used by the marketing agent

4. **Test the System**:
   - Send a test email using the `email_service.py` utility
   - Check that emails are properly stored in the S3 bucket
   - Verify that forwarding works correctly

## Usage Examples

### Sending Marketing Emails

```python
from src.agents.marketing_agent import MarketingAgent

agent = MarketingAgent()

# Create a campaign
campaign_id = agent.create_campaign(
    name="SoulCoreHub Launch",
    product="SoulCoreHub",
    target_audience="AI developers and enthusiasts",
    email_template={
        "subject": "Introducing SoulCoreHub - AI with a Soul",
        "body_html": """
        <h1>Meet SoulCoreHub</h1>
        <p>An evolving, decentralized AI infrastructure born to walk beside — not behind.</p>
        <p><a href="https://example.com/soulcorehub">Learn more</a></p>
        """
    }
)

# Scrape emails
agent.scrape_emails(campaign_id, max_emails=100)

# Execute campaign
agent.execute_campaign(campaign_id)

# Get campaign report
report = agent.get_campaign_report(campaign_id)
print(report)
```

### Accessing Emails in Agents

```python
from src.utils.email_service import EmailService

email_service = EmailService()

# Get new emails
emails = email_service.get_new_emails(folder_prefix="primary", max_count=10)

# Process emails
for email in emails:
    print(f"From: {email['from']}")
    print(f"Subject: {email['subject']}")
    print(f"Body: {email['body']['text'][:100]}...")
    
    # Respond to email
    email_service.send_email(
        to_address=email['from'],
        subject=f"Re: {email['subject']}",
        body_html="<p>Thank you for your email. This is an automated response.</p>"
    )
```

## Maintenance

The system is designed to be self-maintaining, but you should periodically:

1. Check the AWS SES console for any sending limits or issues
2. Monitor the S3 bucket storage usage
3. Review campaign metrics to optimize future campaigns
4. Update email templates based on performance data

Remember that this is a global bootstrapping protocol, not just a deployment script. All applications should be managed under SoulCoreHub's `/apps` route and support rerouting via helo-im.ai.
