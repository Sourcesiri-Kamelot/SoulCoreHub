# SoulCoreHub Security Audit

## Security Vulnerabilities Addressed

### Critical Issues
1. **Exposed GitHub Token in .env file**
   - GitHub Personal Access Token was directly exposed in the .env file
   - Token should be revoked on GitHub immediately
   - New token should be generated with appropriate scopes

2. **Environment File Tracking**
   - .env file was tracked in the repository
   - Now added to .gitignore to prevent credential exposure
   - Created .env.example template file without actual credentials

### Medium Issues
1. **Executable Permissions**
   - Many Python scripts have executable permissions
   - Consider restricting permissions to only necessary scripts

2. **Permission Management**
   - Current permission model may be overly permissive
   - Consider implementing principle of least privilege

## Recommended Future Actions

1. **AWS Security Implementation**
   - When moving to AWS cloud, implement:
     - AWS IAM roles instead of hardcoded credentials
     - AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive credentials
     - Security groups with least privilege access

2. **Code Security Scanning**
   - Implement automated security scanning
   - Tools like Bandit (Python) or SonarQube

3. **Secure Development Practices**
   - Implement code review process
   - Use dependency scanning to identify vulnerable packages
   - Regular security audits

4. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper authentication for all interfaces
   - Role-based access control for different system components

## Immediate Actions Required
1. **Revoke the exposed GitHub token**
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Find and delete the exposed token
   - Generate a new token with appropriate scopes

2. **Update local .env file**
   - Replace the old token with the new one in your local .env file
   - Ensure .env is not committed to git

3. **Review AWS credentials**
   - Check for any AWS credentials in the codebase
   - Move them to secure storage or environment variables
