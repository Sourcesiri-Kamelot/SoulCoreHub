Here's an enhanced design to make SoulCore function as a comprehensive business agency, capable of managing a diverse team of AI agents:

**I. Core Components**

1. **Enhanced Task Management System:**  
   * **Task Definition:**  
     * Task ID: Unique identifier for each task.  
     * Task Type: (e.g., "build website," "write marketing copy," "handle customer inquiry," "generate code")  
     * Task Status: (e.g., "pending," "in progress," "completed," "failed")  
     * Input Data: (e.g., user prompt, specifications, files, context from other tasks)  
     * Configuration: (e.g., target platform, style guidelines, constraints)  
     * Dependencies: (List of Task IDs that must be completed before this task can start)  
     * Priority: (For task scheduling)  
     * Agent Role: (The type of agent best suited for this task, e.g., "Marketing Agent," "Sales Agent")  
   * **Task Queue:**  
     * A priority queue (e.g., using Redis or a database with priority support) to manage tasks efficiently.  
     * Supports adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks.  
     * Handles task dependencies to ensure tasks are executed in the correct order.  
   * **Task Orchestrator:**  
     * Receives tasks from the queue.  
     * Decomposes complex tasks into subtasks, creating a task dependency graph.  
     * Assigns subtasks to agents based on their roles and availability.  
     * Monitors task progress, tracks dependencies, and handles task failures/retries.  
     * Assembles outputs from agents into a final result.  
     * Provides real-time task status updates to the UI.  
2. **Expanded Agent Pool:**  
   * A more detailed and organized collection of specialized AI models:  
     * **Core Business Agents:**  
       * CEO Agent: (Strategic planning, decision-making, high-level communication)  
       * Secretary Agent: (Email/call handling, scheduling, administrative tasks)  
       * Sales Agent: (Lead generation, customer interaction, sales closing)  
       * Marketing & Advertising Agent: (Campaign creation, social media management, market research)  
       * Content Creation Agent: (Blog posts, articles, marketing materials, social media content)  
       * Social Media Management Agent: (Posting, replies, engagement, community building)  
       * Accountant Agent: (Financial management, bookkeeping, reporting)  
       * Legal Agent: (Contract drafting, legal research, compliance)  
     * **Development & Design Agents:**  
       * Build Crew Chief Agent: (Project management, team coordination, technical direction)  
       * Design Style Agent: (UI/UX design, visual branding, style guide creation)  
       * Functionality Agent: (Feature implementation, backend logic, API development)  
       * Code Master Agent: (Code generation in specific languages, code optimization, debugging)  
       * Language Specialist Agent: (Proficiency in 1-3 programming languages, advanced language-specific tasks)  
     * **Educational Support Agents:**  
       * Learning Facilitator Agent: (Curriculum design, personalized learning path creation, progress tracking)  
       * Knowledge Base Agent: (Information retrieval, question answering, resource summarization)  
       * Skill Development Agent: (Exercise generation, feedback provision, mastery tracking in specific domains)  
   * **Agent Metadata:**  
     * Agent ID: Unique identifier for each agent instance.  
     * Agent Role: (e.g., "Sales Agent," "Code Master Agent")  
     * Agent Capabilities: (Detailed description of skills, input formats, output formats, strengths, and weaknesses)  
     * Agent Status: (e.g., "available," "busy," "offline")  
     * Associated Models: (List of Ollama models used by this agent)  
     * Configuration: (Agent-specific settings and parameters)  
3. **Enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) System:**  
   * **Knowledge Base:**  
     * Structured Knowledge Base: Organize information by domain (e.g., "Marketing," "Legal," "Development," "Education"). This allows for more targeted and efficient retrieval of information. For instance, the Marketing department's documents (campaign strategies, market research reports) would be stored separately from Legal documents (contracts, compliance guidelines), preventing irrelevant information from polluting the search results.  
     * Document Indexing: Support for various document types (PDF, Word, Markdown, code files). The system should be able to parse and extract text from these different formats. For PDFs, libraries like PyPDF2 or Apache PDFBox can be used. For Word documents, libraries like python-docx can be employed. For code files, language-specific parsers might be beneficial to extract code structure and comments.  
     * Metadata Tagging: Tag documents with relevant information (e.g., "Marketing Plan," "Legal Contract," "Python Documentation"). Metadata tags are crucial for filtering and refining search results. Examples of useful tags include:  
       * Department: (e.g., "Marketing," "Legal," "Engineering")  
       * Document Type: (e.g., "Report," "Contract," "Code Sample")  
       * Project: (e.g., "Project X," "Project Y")  
       * Date: (e.g., "2024-01-01," "2024-06-30")  
       * Version: (e.g., "v1.0," "v2.3")  
       * Sensitivity: (e.g., "Confidential," "Public")  
   * **Embedding Engine:**  
     * Support multiple embedding models for different data types (text, code). Different types of data may require different embedding models to capture their nuances effectively. For example, a Sentence Transformer model might be suitable for general text, while a CodeBERT model might be better for embedding code snippets. The system should be designed to accommodate this diversity.  
     * Ability to update embeddings when the knowledge base changes. When documents in the knowledge base are added, modified, or deleted, the corresponding embeddings need to be updated to maintain the accuracy of the RAG system. This could involve:  
       * Re-computing embeddings for modified documents.  
       * Adding embeddings for new documents.  
       * Deleting embeddings for deleted documents.  
       * Implementing a mechanism to track changes in the knowledge base and trigger embedding updates.  
   * **Vector Database:**  
     * Use a scalable vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus) to handle a large knowledge base and high query volume. The choice of vector database is critical for performance, especially as the agency's knowledge base grows. Factors to consider include:  
       * Scalability: Can the database handle billions of vectors?  
       * Query Speed: How quickly can the database retrieve similar vectors?  
       * Filtering Capabilities: Does the database support filtering by metadata?  
       * Cost: What is the pricing model of the database?  
       * Ease of Use: How easy is it to integrate with the system?  
     * Support filtering by metadata tags to narrow down search results. This is essential for providing accurate and relevant information to the agents. For example, a Legal Agent might only need to retrieve information from documents tagged with "Legal" and "Contract," while a Marketing Agent might only need documents tagged with "Marketing" and "Campaign."  
   * **Context Retrieval:**  
     * Advanced retrieval strategies:  
       * Hybrid search (combine keyword search with vector search). Combining keyword search (e.g., using Elasticsearch or OpenSearch) with vector search can improve the accuracy of retrieval. Keyword search can quickly narrow down the results to documents containing specific terms, while vector search can then rank those documents based on semantic similarity to the query.  
       * Context windowing (retrieve a larger chunk of text around the relevant passage). Instead of retrieving only the single most similar passage, retrieving a larger context window (e.g., a paragraph or a section) can provide the agent with more context and improve its understanding of the information.  
       * Re-ranking (use an LLM to re-rank the retrieved passages based on relevance). After retrieving a set of candidate passages, an LLM can be used to re-rank them based on their relevance to the specific query and the agent's task. This can help to filter out irrelevant or redundant information and ensure that the agent receives the most useful context.  
     * Agent-Specific Queries: Allow agents to formulate complex queries with specific requirements. Agents should not be limited to simple keyword queries. They should be able to generate more sophisticated queries that reflect their specific needs. For example, an agent might need to ask: "Find the most recent marketing reports that discuss competitor X and mention our new product launch," or "Retrieve the legal clauses related to data privacy in contracts signed with customers in region Y."
