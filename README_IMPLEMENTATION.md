## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup

1. Run the setup script to create the necessary directories and files:

```bash
bash scripts/setup_environment.sh
```

2. Update the `.env` file with your actual credentials.

### Step 2: AWS Infrastructure Deployment

1. Deploy the AWS infrastructure using CloudFormation:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy_infrastructure.sh dev us-east-1
```

This will create:
- Base infrastructure stack
- API Gateway stack
- Agent stacks for each core agent

### Step 3: Agent Implementation

1. Implement each agent by extending the Ethical Agent Framework:

```python
from src.agents.ethical_agent_framework import EthicalAgent

class GPTSoul(EthicalAgent):
    def __init__(self, config_path=None):
        super().__init__("GPTSoul", config_path)
        # Agent-specific initialization
    
    def _execute_action(self, action_type, details):
        # Implement agent-specific action execution
        pass
```

2. Deploy the agent code to AWS Lambda using the CI/CD pipeline.

### Step 4: Commerce Setup

1. Initialize the Ethical Commerce Manager:

```python
from src.commerce.ethical_commerce import EthicalCommerceManager

commerce = EthicalCommerceManager()
```

2. Add vetted affiliate products:

```python
commerce.add_vetted_product(
    product_data={
        'name': 'Product Name',
        'description': 'Product Description',
        'category': 'Category',
        'vendor': 'Vendor',
        'price': 99.99,
        'affiliate_link': 'https://example.com/affiliate'
    },
    verification_notes="Detailed verification notes"
)
```

3. Generate affiliate reports and documentation.

### Step 5: Content Strategy Implementation

1. Initialize the Content Strategy:

```python
from src.content.educational_content import ContentStrategy

content = ContentStrategy()
```

2. Add content ideas and schedule content:

```python
content.add_content_idea({
    'title': 'Content Title',
    'description': 'Content Description',
    'category': 'Category'
})

content.schedule_content({
    'title': 'Content Title',
    'type': 'blog',
    'author': 'Author Name',
    'date': '2025-01-01'
})
```

3. Generate content templates and calendars.

### Step 6: Cultural Framework Setup

1. Initialize the Cultural Library and Worldbuilding Framework:

```python
from src.culture.cultural_framework import CulturalLibrary, WorldbuildingFramework

library = CulturalLibrary()
worldbuilding = WorldbuildingFramework()
```

2. Create cultural assets and fictional worlds:

```python
from src.culture.cultural_framework import CulturalAsset

asset = CulturalAsset(
    asset_type="book",
    title="Book Title",
    creator="Creator Name",
    description="Book Description"
)

library.add_asset(asset)

world_id = worldbuilding.create_world(
    name="World Name",
    description="World Description",
    creator="Creator Name"
)
```

3. Generate documentation and catalogs.
