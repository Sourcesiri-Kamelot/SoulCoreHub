# AI Society Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of the AI Society components for SoulCoreHub.

## Components

- `anima_core.ts`: Generative logic for Anima to create coherent agent traits
- `memory_engine.ts`: Persistent memory system for agents
- `behavior_core.ts`: Autonomous behavior loop for agents
- `economy_system.ts`: Resource management and scarcity system
- `simulation_clock.ts`: World tick system for autonomous evolution

## Implementation Status

These components address the critical gaps in SoulCoreHub's architecture:

1. **Anima's Generative Logic**: Now has real logic for creating agents with coherent traits
2. **Persistent Agent Memory**: Agents now remember prior conversations, relationships, and events
3. **Behavioral Core**: Agents can now act autonomously with initiative and decision-making
4. **Economy System**: Introduces scarcity and resource constraints for evolutionary pressure
5. **Simulation Clock**: Enables the society to evolve over time without user interaction

## Next Steps

- Implement TypeScript compilation setup
- Create DynamoDB tables for persistent storage
- Integrate with the existing SoulCoreHub architecture
