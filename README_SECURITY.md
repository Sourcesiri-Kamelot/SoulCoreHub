# SoulCoreHub Security Guide

This document outlines the security architecture and best practices implemented in SoulCoreHub.

## Security Architecture

SoulCoreHub implements a defense-in-depth security strategy:

```
                  +----------------+
                  | Rate Limiting  |
                  +----------------+
                          |
                          v
+----------------+  +----------------+  +----------------+
| HTTPS/TLS      |->| Security       |->| Authentication |
+----------------+  | Headers        |  +----------------+
                    +----------------+          |
                          |                     v
                          v              +----------------+
                    +----------------+   | Authorization  |
                    | Input          |   +----------------+
                    | Validation     |          |
                    +----------------+          v
                          |           +----------------+
                          +---------->| Business Logic |
                                      +----------------+
```

## Key Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-based Access Control**: Different permission levels based on user roles
- **Token Refresh**: Secure token refresh mechanism
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with proper salt rounds
- **MFA Support**: Framework for multi-factor authentication

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Validation and sanitization of all inputs
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery protection
- **Security Headers**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict cross-origin resource sharing policy

### Data Security

- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive credentials
- **Environment Variables**: Secure handling of configuration
- **Data Encryption**: Encryption for sensitive data at rest
- **TLS/HTTPS**: Encryption for data in transit
- **Secure Defaults**: Secure default configurations

### Payment Security

- **Stripe Integration**: PCI-compliant payment processing
- **Tokenization**: Card details never touch our servers
- **Webhook Signatures**: Verification of Stripe webhook events
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of payment events

## Security Middleware

The security middleware (`security/security_middleware.js`) provides:

- **Content Security Policy**: Controls which resources can be loaded
- **XSS Protection**: Protection against cross-site scripting attacks
- **CSRF Protection**: Protection against cross-site request forgery
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Validation and sanitization of all inputs

## Security Headers

SoulCoreHub implements the following security headers:

- **Content-Security-Policy**: Controls which resources can be loaded
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Protection against cross-site scripting attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **X-Frame-Options**: Protection against clickjacking
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS

## AWS Security Integration

When deployed to AWS, SoulCoreHub leverages:

- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access for AWS services
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure storage of sensitive credentials
- **Security Groups**: Network-level access control
- **CloudTrail**: Audit logging for AWS API calls
- **WAF**: Web Application Firewall for additional protection

## Security Best Practices

### Password Policy

- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- Bcrypt hashing with appropriate work factor
- Regular password rotation encouraged

### API Security

- All endpoints properly authenticated and authorized
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Input validation on all parameters
- Proper error handling that doesn't leak information

### Logging & Monitoring

- Security events logged with appropriate detail
- Sensitive data never logged
- Structured logging for easier analysis
- Monitoring for suspicious activities

## Security Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Identify**: Determine the scope and impact
2. **Contain**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Eradicate**: Remove the threat
4. **Recover**: Restore systems to normal operation
5. **Learn**: Analyze the incident and improve security

## Security Testing

Regular security testing includes:

- **Static Analysis**: Code scanning for vulnerabilities
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Runtime testing for vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Checking for vulnerable dependencies
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulated attacks to find vulnerabilities
